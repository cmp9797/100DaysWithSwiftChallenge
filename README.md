Hey everyone!

I joined the 100 Days with Swift Challenge. I want to share my learning progress by making a summary or notes about it (To keep me on track ðŸ¤­). If you are interested in iOS Development and want to start learning about it, you can join this challengeÂ [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100). 
Letâ€™s learn together!ðŸ”¥

> [!NOTE]
> _Open it on your playground to get better experience._
> _If you want a quick experimentation, you can copy the code to [Online Swift Playground](https://swiftfiddle.com)._

> _To create your own new playground you can go to ``` Xcode File > New > Playground ```._
